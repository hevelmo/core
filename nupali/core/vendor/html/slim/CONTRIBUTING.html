<h1 id="how-to-contribute">How to Contribute</h1>
<h2 id="pull-requests">Pull Requests</h2>
<ol>
<li>Fork the Slim Framework repository</li>
<li>Create a new branch for each feature or improvement</li>
<li>Send a pull request from each feature branch to the <strong>develop</strong> branch</li>
</ol>
<p>It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a
pull request for each branch. This allows me to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.</p>
<h2 id="style-guide">Style Guide</h2>
<p>All pull requests must adhere to the <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md">PSR-2 standard</a>.</p>
<h2 id="unit-testing">Unit Testing</h2>
<p>All pull requests must be accompanied by passing unit tests and complete code coverage. The Slim Framework uses phpunit for testing.</p>
